# Song of RedBard ðŸŽ¶

## Verse 1
I've walked through shadows, faced the night,  
Danced with fear but found my light.  
Now the winds are calling me,  
To sing a song of destiny.  

With a lute in hand and heart set free,  
I weave a tune for you and me.  
A melody to lift us high,  
To touch the stars and kiss the sky.  

## Pre-Chorus
**Oh, warriors strong, defenders true,**  
**Magicians wise, with skies so blue,**  
**Healers, dreamers, seekers allâ€”**  
**Come hear my call, come hear my callâ€¦**  

## Chorus ðŸŽ¶
**Sing with me, let love be known,**  
**A song of peace, we're not alone!**  
**Let hope ignite, let fear unwind,**  
**For in this tune, our souls align.**  
**Oh, we rise, oh, we shine,**  
**With every note, the world is divine!**  

## Verse 2
The Rangerâ€™s bow, the Rogueâ€™s quick blade,  
The Clericâ€™s light, the spells they braid.  
The Necromancerâ€™s whispered lore,  
The Enchanterâ€™s dreamâ€”a world restored.  

Through battle cries and whispered prayer,  
Through fire and frost, through earth and air,  
I sing a song to guide the way,  
For love and truth will never stray.  

## Bridge
But I think I'm about to start anew,  
To get rooted deep, to see what's true.  
To tame my shadow, let it dance,  
To give my love a fighting chance.  

To hear, to sing, to heal, to grow,  
To speak the truth, to let love flow.  
To weave a dream where all belong,  
Together nowâ€”we sing as one!  

## Chorus (Uplifted & Full) ðŸŽ¶
**Sing with me, let love be known,**  
**A song of peace, we're not alone!**  
**Let hope ignite, let fear unwind,**  
**For in this tune, our souls align.**  
**Oh, we rise, oh, we shine,**  
**With every note, the world is divine!**  

## Outro (Soft & Ethereal)
So take my hand, weâ€™ll journey far,  
With music bright as guiding stars.  
Through every class, through dark and light,  
Together now, our souls take flightâ€¦  

ðŸŽ¶ **Oh, we riseâ€¦ oh, we shineâ€¦** ðŸŽ¶
